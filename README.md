# Hello!
The first 2 files are Vector2F and Polynomial
## Vector2F
Represents a 2-dimensional Point (x,y).<br>
One can:
* add 2 Points
* sub 2 Points
* multiple Point by const (number)
* find the distance between 2 Points
## Polynomial
Represents a function (y=a*x^2+b*x+c).<br>
One can:
* find min/max/edge
* find x/y axis
* find f(x)
